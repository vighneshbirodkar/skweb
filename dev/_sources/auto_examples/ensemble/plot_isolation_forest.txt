IsolationForest example
==========================================

An example using IsolationForest for anomaly detection.

The IsolationForest 'isolates' observations by randomly selecting a feature
and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum
values of the selected feature.

Since recursive partitioning can be represented by a tree structure, the
number of splittings required to isolate a sample is equivalent to the path
length from the root node to the terminating node.

This path length, averaged over a forest of such random trees, is a measure
of abnormality and our decision function.

Random partitioning produces noticeable shorter paths for anomalies.
Hence, when a forest of random trees collectively produce shorter path lengths
for particular samples, they are highly likely to be anomalies.
